# The Great Feline-Canine Sorter! 🐶

Welcome to the ultimate showdown: Dogs vs. Cats! 🐱 This project uses the mighty power of TensorFlow and Transfer Learning (with MobileNetV2) to build a neural network that can tell a pupper from a kitty.

This notebook demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow: data extraction, preprocessing, model building (using a pre-trained model), training, evaluation, and finally, a predictive system to test your own images.

## What's Inside?

* `dog_vs_cat_classification_transfer_learning.ipynb`: The main Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook containing all the code.
* `data/`: This directory is expected to contain the original `dogs-vs-cats.zip` file.
* `data/image resized/`: This directory is automatically created by the notebook to store the 2,000 resized images used for training and testing.

## The Workflow (How it Works)

The notebook follows these key steps:

1.  **Data Extraction**: The script first unzips the `dogs-vs-cats.zip` file located in the `data/` folder.

2.  **Image Preprocessing**:
    * It counts the total number of images (25,000) in the `data/train` directory.
    * It then creates a new folder (`data/image resized`).
    * Crucially, it takes a **subset of 2,000 images** (1,000 dogs, 1,000 cats) from the original training set, resizes them all to 224x224 pixels, converts them to RGB, and saves them in the new `data/image resized/` folder.
3.  **Labeling**:
    * It loads these 2,000 resized images into a NumPy array.
    * It creates corresponding labels based on the filenames: `0` for 'cat' and `1` for 'dog'.
4.  **Train/Test Split**: The 2,000 images (`X`) and their labels (`Y`) are split into a training set (1,600 images) and a test set (400 images) using an 80/20 split.
5.  **Scaling**: The pixel values of the images are scaled from the 0-255 range to a 0-1 range by dividing by 255. This is a standard practice for neural networks.

## The Model 🤖 (Transfer Learning Magic)

Instead of building a complex Convolutional Neural Network from scratch, we use **Transfer Learning**:

* **Base Model**: We use the powerful **MobileNetV2** model from TensorFlow Hub as our feature extractor. This model has already been trained on millions of images and knows how to identify basic features.
* **Freezing**: The pre-trained layers of MobileNetV2 are "frozen" (`trainable=False`) so their weights don't change during our training. We are essentially using it as a feature converter.
* **Top Layer**: We build a simple `tf.keras.Sequential` model. We add the MobileNetV2 layer first, followed by a single `Dense` output layer with 2 units (one for 'cat', one for 'dog').

## Training & Performance

* **Compilation**: The model is compiled using the `adam` optimizer and `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` loss.
* **Training**: It is trained for 5 epochs on the 1,600 scaled training images.
* **Final Accuracy**:
    * **Training Accuracy:** ~99.37%
    * **Test Accuracy:** ~97.75%

This high accuracy after just 5 epochs shows the power of using a pre-trained model!

## How to Use (The Predictive System)

1.  Run all the cells in the notebook from top to bottom to train the model.
2.  The final cell block is the "Predictive System".
3.  Upload your own cat or dog image to the Colab environment (e.g., `my_dog.jpg`).
4.  When prompted by the input box (`Path of the image to be predicted:`), enter the path to your image (e.g., `/content/my_dog.jpg`).
5.  The script will load, resize, and scale your image, feed it to the trained model, and print its prediction: "The image represents a Cat" or "The image represents a Dog".
